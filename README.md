cs401 (ML) Assignment 2 - Lovey Dovey 

As noted in the report, I've worked using a Collaboratoy .ipynb notebook and have been reading and writing the files to my Drive folder.
Still, I think runnable_MLa2_QUIMHM.py should work to read "test_i.txt" from the same directory as the .py is and to create "test_o.txt" there as well. 
No arguments are needed as the names of the files are hardcoded in the program (but can be easily found and changed if the paths weren't the appropriate ones). 
If this doesn't work to rerun the code and replicate the results on your machine (because of some unexpected exception or issues with some of the libraries specified in the report and code) feel free to reach out to me about it or try to run online the executable sections of the .ipynb that I also have uploaded to this repository.

/////////////////OUTDATED EXTENSION REQUEST, ALREADY DELIVERED!////////////////////////////
I'M PLANNING TO HAVE MY SUBMISSION ACTUALLY "PRESENTABLE" AS OF TONIGHT (i wasn't expecting the original deadline to be at 17:00)
TO MAKE IT A SURE THING, LET'S SAY IT WILL BE COMPLETE BY 6/12/22 - 23:55pm, TOMORROW.

Thanks. 
[I'd been stuck on 60-65% performance until today and I just recently made a breakthrough in that sense so I have to update the report and test-o.txt, etc]
